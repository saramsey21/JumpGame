# Simple 2D Jumping Game
Welcome to my first project in game development!

This game is a simple 2d game where the player needs to dodge around incoming obstacles.

## New Technologies Used
**Pygame**

As someone who has been intrigued by games since I can remember, I wanted to try and learn how to develop games myself. I decided to look into a simple game dev platform to get the basic ideas down, so I chose pygame as my first project.

This game was created by following this tutorial: [The Ultimate Introduction to Pygame](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY9MnQ4x3zk)

## What I Learned

- Creating entity surfaces
- Entity movement
- Animation
